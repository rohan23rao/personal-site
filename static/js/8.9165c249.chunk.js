I am really interested in Machine Learning, as well as Computer Science. My main interests are in NLP and GAN's as well as developing Web Applications. I am particularly interested in projects that deal with hardware such as aerospace and flight as well as submersibles and also projects that can create social impact. My passions extend to Music and Sports. I have played Waterpolo for several years as well as Tennis for my High School teams. I have also played in band and have an interest in making and playing music. Check out my recent music project [here](/projects). If you think I can be helpful to you or would like to meet me, please feel free to get in touch.\n\n# Currently\n\nI have been taking several Machine Learning Courses through Coursera, including the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning), and have learned how to train and build neural networks and the mathematics and science behind them. I am currently working on several machine learning projects, and I hope to make change. I am also a tennis coach at [Mountain View Tennis](https://www.mountainviewtennis.net/), teaching the [Rally Ball](/resume#experience).
